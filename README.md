# HumanBench-Final
 This is my final project for my Internet Programming II class

 ## What is it?
 The final project for my Internet Programming II class was open ended with what we could do, so I decided to create a webpage that was similar to a Human Benchmark test. <br>
 This webpage has an array of words, and it generates a number to display the word in that position. The user then has to say whether or not they have seen the word yes. You get three lives, and you can restart the game after you lose to go for a higher score.

 ## How did I do?
 I got full score for this assignment. The turned in assignment did have a button to display an image, but that was to satisfy a requirement for the assignment, so I did not include it here.
